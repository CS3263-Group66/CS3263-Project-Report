\section{Conclusion}

 This prototype of application has utilized various skills and knowledge from CS3263. Reasoning techniques such as Bayesian Networks has been applied to represent uncertain knowledge and draw new conclusions and evidence from existing knowledge. We then utilize a decision system for the recommendation of recipes. Lastly, machine learning will be employed to improve the performance of the system. In the future, we plan to apply reinforcement learning and integration with IoT to improve the capacity of the agent to make more favorable decisions and better sense the environment.
